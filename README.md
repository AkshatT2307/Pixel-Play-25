# Pixel-Play-25

## Description
This project implements a zero-shot learning image classifier to categorize images onto 50 classes without directly training them onto 10 hidden classes. It uses attribute embeddings to achive classification using semantic vector space.

## Features
- Zero-shot classiffication
- Use of Pre-trained EfficientNetb0 model

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of 58% on Pixel-play train dataset.
- 99% on the the Special-Package.


## Project Structure
- README.md file
- Codebase
- Output CSV's
- Predicate matrix CSV's

## Other Ideas
Use of meta learning and prototype learning for better results. I have studied their concepts but unable to implement them. Would love to implement them with team VLG

## Acknowledgements
- Studied few research papers related to zero- shot classification and the use of vector embeddings.
- Pre-trained EfficientNetb0 model
